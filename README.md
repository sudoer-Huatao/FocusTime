## 🔧How to install

Download the .dmg file from the latest releases tab, open it, and **drag the app to your Applications folder**.

**⚠️Important: I don't have a Apple Developer Account (yet. I'm poor :( ), so your computer might pop up a warning that says something like this:**

```"FocusTime" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.```

**You'll need to go to System Settings>Privacy and Security to manually allow the app to be opened.**
